# Passwords
Java program that keeps credentials info.
 Sometimes you need to log in into 1, 2, 3, etc.. accounts on a foreign computer and being quick as possible. This program do so. It is meant to keep your passwords and give them to you with a click copying it into the clipboard. At the end of the day it is supposed that you will delete the "data" file generated because you no longer need a quick log in tool. You can store all your passwords there and use the program as a password keeper, but it is not recomended because the "data" file can be readed easily with any txt editor.
